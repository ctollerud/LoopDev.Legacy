MIDI controller mappings:
NanoKontrols (will soon be consolidated onto launchpad 2)
	All values are notes:
	14-18: Delay Controls
		14: Set to 1/16
		15: Set to 1/8
		16: Set to 3/16
		17: Set to 1/4
		18: Pingpong/simple delay toggle
	
	**112-123 : Right half of second nano
		112-119 : Instrument Selection
		120-123 : Pedal Control
		
	19-21: Reverb Decay Length

MIDI Fighter:
	36-99: MIDI Fighter (currently channel 3?)
		36-51: Bank A
		52-67: Bank B
		68-83: Bank C
		84-99: Bank D
		
Code:

	CC:
	encoders: CC #'s 0 - 31
		encoders are mapped spatially, the bottom left encoder starting at 0,
		row 1: 0-7
		row 2: 8-15
		row 3: 16-23
		row 4: 24-31

	Notes:
		0 (C-2): clear FX chain
		1 (C#-2): clear ADC chain
		2 (D-2): "last" button

		Vol/Gate/Pan toggle
		3 (D#-2) = Vol
		4 (E-2) = Pan
		5 (F-2) = Gate 



Launchpad:  hard-coded/unmappable


MIDI loopback Mappings (MIDI Loopback):

launchpad 2 Loopback: (config launchpad, channel 2)
	Notes:
		C-2 to D#-2 : Delay selection ---?? verify thisâ€¦and what does what...
		E-2 to B-2 : Loop Pedal Toggle
			Controls which looper the pedals are set to control

	MIDI CC:
		22: Instrument Selector
		40 : Delay Rate--
		41 : Delay Type	--
		42 : Reverb Decay ---not currently mapped
	       43 : Prebuffer length selector
                    0 = 1 measure
                    1 = 2 mm
                    2 = 4 mm
                    3 = 8 mm
                    4 = 16 mm
                    5 = 2 n
                    6 = 1 n
                    7 =  8n
		    8 = 16n

CODE Loopback - channel 4

	Notes:
		D 0: Normalize ADC FX--xx?

	MIDI CC:
		0-7: Pan -- unmapped until exposed to the code
		8: "Last" Button -- (in use?)
		10-19: BCR Chain FX ---
		20: ADC Reverb ---
		21: ADC Delay ---
		101-108 : Looper Volume ---
		109-116: Looper Gate ---
	
		117-124 more main chain effects ---
			117: phasing effect --
                       118: beat repeat pitch decay
			is it 123 that's busted?

		125 : Metronome Volume --- 
		127 : metronome on/off/volume --


Launchpad (Loopers) LoopBack (channel 2):
	Notes:
		C 0 - metronome tempo init (pressing the tempo/deactivate button to start metro, set tempo )
		C # 0 - metronome off 
		D# 0 to A# 0: use for talkback -- talkback for BCR Looper Track Normalization (tracks 1-8 respectively )
			-MIDI is mapped to BCR Normalization Modules
		B 0 (35)  -- init. loop cancel
		C 1 - G 1 -- 36-43 --- looper  pre-buffering triggers


	MIDI CC:
		45 - 60 : Main Looper CTL
			45-52 : Record
				0: off
				126: resample
				127: regular record

		53-60 : Overdub
		61-68 : On/Off

		69-100 : Chain/Resample Routings--
			69-76 : Direct/Chain routing
			77-84 : direct resample send


		CC # 123 appears to not want to route!

	126: Looper Source:
		0 = ADC
		127 = Resample

	MIDI Fighter (channel 5:)
		cc:
			0: beat repeat on/off
			1: beat repeat rate
